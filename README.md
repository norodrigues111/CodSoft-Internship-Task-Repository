SOURCE 2: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input
TASK: Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
TASK:Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
